# GraphRAG for a travel blog
Using [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/) graph database I created a RAG system utilizing knowledge graphs. <br> 

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
Goal is to scrape a website and load the text file using langchain. And by using Cypher query language(retrieving), we can get structured and contextualizaed response from an LLM. <br> 
Blog : [Seven Sister Hill](https://fitnesstravelfood.com/seven-sisters-hill-the-best-trek-near-nagpur/)


### Knowledge graphs 
These are graphs which have been created using the graph transformers. In future work, I can improve the quality of node and relationships by manually creating it. <br>

The above graph captures the 7 different hills which are the part of the Seven Sister hill. <br> 
Some more important relationships captured.
