Seven Sisters Hill, Perjagadh is situated in the Chandrapur District, adjacent to Sonapur Village, 106 kilometers from Nagpur. The Hill, which is 459 meters high and 35 kilometers long, is what gives the hill its name, Seven Sisters Hill. Hills named Muktai, Ambai, Nimbai, Mahakali, Lakshmi, Durga, and Saraswati the seven sisters.It’s a one-day trip from Nagpur. The best option for weekend getaways.To get there, take the Umrer-Bhisi Highway.It takes approx 2 hours and 30 minutes from the Zero mile Nagpur with zero Tolls. (At least we got zero tolls)Never knew such an amazing trek spot near my native place. I’ve been living here for like 20 years. But never explored Seven Sisters Hill. Surprisingly hola, all! Here’s a friendly reminder that this year’s 2025 monsoon season has almost knocked at your doorstep. Visit Seven Sisters Hill before the monsoon ends, if you want to experience the adventure and the most breathtaking views.

Well, are you interested in joining us on our exciting sustainable travel and trek journey to Seven Sisters Hill?? Are you ready to have a unique and memorable experience? Fill out the below form, and we will send you all the details! Stay Alive!
Let’s begin with a few questions.Do you enjoy trekking or hiking?Do you enjoy spending time outdoors in Nature?Well…who doesn’t want to be in Nature, as we all are now living in the concrete jungle!Let me ask you one more thing.Are you a fitness freak?
The reason I asked these questions is that trekking tests your fitness level. Your stamina, strength, mindset, focus, etc. If you’re a fitness fanatic, then there’s no issue. But if you’re not, then it will preach you or inspire you to get fit.Just like that!Ergo, frequent treks are worth it for your health and fitness. So here’s my journey to seven sisters hill. What could possibly go wrong the moment you wake up on the day of your trek? Well in my case, a heavy rain!It kinda disappointed us.What else could you expect during the monsoon season in August?At the same time, we didn’t want to postpone the plan, so we decided to stick to the plan and prepared our minds to get wet during the trek.Actually, It was becoming more adventurous. 
Just stay aligned with nature. It will take you to the places you never imagined.

At 7 AM, three of my friends and I set out on our journey to Seven Sisters Hill.We took the four-wheeler and prepared for the long drive.The overall travel to Seven Sisters Hill was quite exciting. The Umred-Bhisi route’s highway infrastructure was quite smooth and had no tolls along the way. (Although we did cross one toll it wasn’t functional) We followed Google Maps, and it led us in the right direction. With two stops along the way, the trip took approx. 2:30 hours.Suddenly on the way itself, weather kinda blessed us with the so-called “Perfect Weather“. It stopped raining outside. The weather was quite crisp with a moderate fresh breeze, plus the cloudy skies saved us from the sunlight Tan. (This is one of the reasons I urged people to come here before the monsoon season ends!)
We drove to our destination, Seven Sisters Hill, parked our car there, and they charged us around Rs. 50/-There was adequate parking space for travelers to park there. A variety of local stalls were also available onsite, including food(snacks only), but carry your own if possible.We grabbed our backpacks with the essentials and began the hike.From below, you would be able to see the hill height, where you could have a glance at a few people standing at the cliff of the hill which reminded me of ANTS.This would allow you to see how far you have to trek. This made us feel more energized and challenged.Trek begins with stairs and it looks like a temple entrance.After a few steps, the stairs ended, and the actual trek began.It’s a slant trek, not a plain trail, but one covered with gravel, stones, and rocks.After 15-20 Minutes of the trek, we felt the difficulty of this trek. (Easy-Moderate Level Trek)I’ve seen few people returning back from the midpoint of the trek because they became exhausted. But trust me, have patience, take as many breaks as you need in the middle of the trek but don’t give up.Because once you reach the top of the hill, the view will make the discomfort negligible. All your anguish will be forgotten. Your efforts will be rewarded by the peace and beautiful vista.It was a dense forest, so dense that the tree canopy prevented us from seeing the sky. Above us, it appears to be like a natural shade. Perfect for hiking on sunny days because it shields your skin from UV rays.We continued on our trek. The vista grew more breathtaking and lively as we drew nearer to the summit.We could now feel the cool breeze, which soon refreshed our souls and carried away all of our fatigue.
We finally made it to the peak after an hour of trekking. Your heart would literally spell, “WoW, grateful to be here” The feeling that can’t be expressed but only felt.After watching the panorama. Which was undefinable. I’ve been to many different treks, but every trek gave me unique experiences.The hilltop was surrounded by hills and greenery all around, and the dense forest and cold breeze that carried only pure oxygen which revived our spirits. From the summit, one could also glimpse a few lakes and ponds.Nothing except Mother Nature was visible on the horizon, not a single concrete structure!  Such a wonderful place to be.We also came across an elderly woman, maybe 80 years old, who had hiked barefoot to the peak to take in the spectacular view. She was inspiring everyone around her to trek. Including Us! It’s all about the mindset.
We then sat on the rocks atop the hill and relished the view while munching the fruits and the lunch we had brought with us.Well, I believe that this is a true luxury.In Nature!With Nature!Align with Nature!An experience to treasure.We took a few photographs to capture the moment, and then we hiked back down the hill. Approaching the starting point on the way back took only 30 minutes. In order to make us feel less worn out, nature spilled soothing rain on us.
Trekking will always offer you the the best views and the most memorable experiences in life. Now go & have them!
